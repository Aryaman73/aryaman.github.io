# Personal Website

This is just the code for my personal website, hosted using GitHub Pages. 

NOTE: I'm currently in the process of changing my deployment process, so my website will be down for the forseaable future :(
    
URL: aryaman73.github.io & aryamans.me

Domain thanks to: namecheap.me

# Notes: 

Creating a new post: `hugo new posts/name-of-post.md`
Notion's exporting to markdown works surprisingly well, with headings and code blocks working as-is. Links might require more work.

External Website: Add `https` in URL for external websites. Format is `[link text](https://link.com)`

Image: Format is `![Image Alt Text](/sub-folder-in-static/name-of-file.png)`
