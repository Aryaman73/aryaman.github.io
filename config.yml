      - I'm Aryaman, a 3B Computer Engineering Student at the University of Waterloo.

      - 

      - I've worked at companies like Relay Platform, Versett, Telus and PointClickCare, where I built and maintained large scale applications with React, Ruby on Rails, Java and more. I enjoy building accessible, reliable and thoughtfully-designed applications that focus on the end-user above all.
      
      - 

      - I'm currently part of the Waterloo Engineering Society, working as a the Website Director and WEC Technical Director. In the past, you might have met me volunteering with Midnight Sun, Waterloo ECE Society, or HackTheNorth. 
      
      - 

      - Feel free to reach out to me if you want to talk, work together or just vent about CSS. Oh, and I'm also looking for 2023 Summer/Fall internship opportunities ðŸ‘€.
