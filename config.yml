      - I'm Aryaman, a software developer based in Waterloo! ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ I recently graduated from the University of Waterloo's Computer Engineering program. ðŸŽ“

      - 

      - In the past, I've worked at Tesla as a Software Engineering Intern in the Firmware Build & Infra team, where I worked on large-scale infrastructure projects using Typescript, Python and Ruby. I've also worked at Relay Platform, Versett, Telus and PointClickCare, where I built and maintained large scale applications with React, Ruby on Rails, Java and more. I enjoy building accessible, reliable and thoughtfully-designed applications that focus on the end-user above all.
