      - I'm Aryaman, a 4th Year Computer Engineering Student at the University of Waterloo.

      - 

      - I'm currently working at Tesla as a Software Engineering in the Firmware Platforms team, where I'm working on large-scale infrastructure projects using Python and Ruby on Rails. In the past, I&rsquo;ve worked at Relay Platform, Versett, Telus and PointClickCare, where I built and maintained large scale applications with React, Ruby on Rails, Java and more. I enjoy building accessible, reliable and thoughtfully-designed applications that focus on the end-user above all.

      - For the Winter 2023 term, I'm also working as the Website Director for UW Engineering Society. In the past, you might have met me volunteering with Midnight Sun, Waterloo ECE Society, Waterloo Engineering Competition or HackTheNorth.

      - Feel free to reach out to me if you want to talk, work together or just vent about CSS. Oh, and I'm also looking for 2023 Summer/Fall internship opportunities ðŸ‘€
