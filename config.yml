      - I'm Aryaman, a software developer based in Toronto! ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ I recently graduated from the University of Waterloo's Computer Engineering program. ðŸŽ“

      - 

      - Previously, I interned at Tesla as a Software Engineer on the Firmware Build & Infrastructure team, where I contributed to large-scale infrastructure projects using TypeScript, Python, and Ruby. Iâ€™ve also worked at Telus, PointClickCare, and Versett, creating accessible, reliable, and thoughtfully-designed applications with a focus on user experience.

      - Outside of work, you might know me as a mentor at HackTheNorth and StarterHacks or from volunteering with Midnight Sun, the Waterloo ECE Society, and the Waterloo Engineering Competition.
