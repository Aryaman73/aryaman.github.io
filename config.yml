      - I'm Aryaman, a 4th Year Computer Engineering Student at the University of Waterloo.

      - 

      - I'm currently working at Tesla as a Software Engineering Intern in the Firmware Build & Infrastructure team, where I'm working on large-scale infrastructure projects using Typescript, Python and Ruby. In the past, I&rsquo;ve worked at Relay Platform, Versett, Telus and PointClickCare, where I built and maintained large scale applications with React, Ruby on Rails, Java and more. I enjoy building accessible, reliable and thoughtfully-designed applications that focus on the end-user above all.

      - In the past, you might have met me volunteering with Midnight Sun, Waterloo ECE Society, Waterloo Engineering Competition or HackTheNorth.

      - Feel free to reach out to me if you want to talk, work together or just vent about CSS. Oh, and I'm currently looking for 2024 New Grad positions ðŸ‘€
