In many ways, getting my J1 Visa was harder than getting my internship, since there is no Blind 75 to help you overcome bureaucracy and long wait times. Though there is a lot of information online, it can feel scattered and hard to find. This is particularly true for non Canadian citizens, since we also have to do an interview at the US Consulate. That’s where this guide (hopefully) comes in.

Before I begin, here are some excellent guides made by other UW students you may want to check out:

# Basics

The J1 Visa is an "exchange visitor” visa, which is meant to give students, teachers or researchers the opportunity to study, train or work in the US. The key thing to note here is that this is not a traditional "work" visa (like TN or H1B), and is meant to be more for cultural exchange or training (in fact, exchange students studying at a US university also apply for the J1 Visa). This is why you will have a sponsor (like Intrax or Cultural Vistas) do the main leg work for the visa.

- The J1 Visa is issued according to the start and end date for your internship, but you can enter/leave the US **30 days** before/after the start/end date.

- The J1 Visa can be either **single-entry** (you can only enter the US once) or **multiple-entry** (you can enter the US multiple times before your internship end date). 
    - Multiple-entry visas are obviously preferable, and you can (allegedly) request one during your US consulate interview, though they may not grant it to you. Anecdotally, since 2023, everyone I have spoken to was given a multiple-entry visa without asking for it.

> ❗ Most non-Canadian J1 Visa holders are subject to a 2-year home residency requirement, which means that you have to return to your home country for 2 years before you can apply for a green card or H1B. Home country refers to your country of citizenship, so you can NOT clear this requirement by living in another country. **This is a VERY important thing to look into if you're an international student.**

# Process

The process for getting a J1 Visa is as follows:

0. After signing an offer, the company will set you up with a sponsor (Intrax or Cultural Vistas).
1. You submit your information to your sponsor
2. Wait to get the DS 2019, DS 7002 & SEVIS payment receipt from your sponsor
3. Fill and Submit the DS 160 Form
4. Book a visa interview appointment at your country’s consulate
5. Go to the interview, submit your passport
6. Receive your passport in the mail / pick-up from Canada Post

Steps 2, 5 and 6 are the real time-killers, since it involves waiting for bureaucracy. If you are a Canadian citizen, you skip step 4, 5, and 6, since you get your visa at the border.

> ❗ I only have experience with Intrax, though the overall steps with Cultural Vistas should be similar.

## Step 1: Submit your information to Sponsor
Once you've signed your internship offer, your company will set you up with a sponsor and (hopefully) an immigration consultant. In this step, you will be asked to submit your personal information, documents (e.g. passports, transcripts, etc.), academic details and internship details. For Intrax, this is done on their online portal, and is fairly straight forward.

This step is 100% dependent on you - **do this as soon as you can** (it should not take more than a day or two). Your process will not move forward until you complete this step. If you're in a situation where you need clarification on how to enter a minor part of the form, I would err on the side of submitting it with your best guess, and then contacting your sponsor to ask whether you did it correctly, because amending your form is a lot easier than waiting for your sponsor to get back to you. 

## Step 2: Wait to get your DS-forms and SEVIS payment receipt
Your sponsor will use this information to generate your DS-2019 and DS-7002 forms, and will make a payment to SEVIS for your application.

- DS-2019 (Certificate of Eligibility): Contains information about you, your sponsor, and your internship (including start and end dates). This is the most important document for your visa application. 
  
- DS-7002 (Training/Internship Placement Plan): Contains (more) information about your internship, including your supervisor's information, your job description and expected responsibilities. 
    - I've noticed that the information in this form may not match your actual role exactly (presumably because it is filled out by HR and not your immigration manager). Regardless, you should have a general idea of your role and responsibilities as mentioned *in this form*, since that is what your interveiwer will be looking at.
  
- SEVIS Payment Receipt: Proof that your sponsor has paid the SEVIS fee required for your application. This was attached alongside DS-7002 for me, but you can also get it from [this link](https://www.fmjfee.com/#) (you will need your SEVIS ID, which is on your DS-2019).
    - This is not a payment for the consulate interview, which will come later.

This step can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks, depending on how fast your sponsor is and how persistent you are. If you haven't heard back from your sponsor in a week, I would recommend emailing them and your company's recruiter/immigration consultant. **Please be persistent** - I have heard stories of this step getting lost in bureaucracy for months.

These forms were normally sent by physical mail with a wet signature, but since Summer '23 Intrax has switched to using Docusign to sign these documents which is much quicker. If you do get it in physical mail, please keep the document safe since you need the original signature for your consulate interview.

Please note that you can start doing Step 3 while you wait to get your forms back.
## Step 3: Complete your DS 160 Form and submit it
The DS-160 is a general form that is required for almost every US visa application. It asks for your personal information, family information, travel history, employment history, education, and a whole lot more. The link for this form is [https://ceac.state.gov/genniv/](https://ceac.state.gov/genniv/).

This is a long form, and will take you a few dedicated hours to complete (probably over a few days). You only require your DS-2019 and SEVIS payment receipt on the very last step of this form, so I would recommend starting this form as soon as possible, and submitting it once you have those documents on hand.

Note that "submitting" this form does nothing other than storing it in some server somewhere and generating a confirmation barcode you use to book the interview. Though you can not edit the information after submitting it, you can always create a new form and use that to book your consulate interview. Once your interview is booked, however, you can not change the information on the linked DS-160.

### Location of Interview
You need to select the exact embassy you want to interview at while creating your DS-160 form, so now might be the time to discuss the consulate situation (specific to Canada). The wait times for interviews at any of these consulates is long - usually too long for you to get your visa in time before your internship begins. You can find the wait times for each consulate [here](https://ais.usvisa-info.com/en-ca/niv/information/visa_wait_times), but from my experience, the wait times are not always accurate. 

> 💡 If you're considering multiple locations due to long wait times, you can fill in and save identical DS-160 forms for multiple locations and decide which location to go for when you're booking the interview.

The not-so-secret solution to these long wait times is **expedited appointments**. All Canadian consulates offer expedited appointments, which you can request once you have booked your interview and paid the fee. However, you must have a valid reason for requesting an expedited appointment, and you must provide proof of this reason. The most relevant reason for us is if the earliest interview date you could get was **after your internship start date.** 

> 💡 This can lead to some inetresting situations. For instance, if your internship begins on January 5, and the earliest interview dates for Ottawa and Toronto is January 2 and January 27, you will actually be better of booking your interview at Toronto, since you will be eligible for an expedited appointment. (The expedited appointment system does not consider the fact that it takes 1 - 2 week after your appointment for you to get your passport back 🙃)

Here are some other pointers I have after going through this process twice:
- Assuming you are on the East Coast, **Toronto is the best consulate** in my opinion. It always has incredibly long wait times which is, ironically, good, since it means you are almost always eligible for an expedited appointment. Toronto approves expedited appointment requests within a day or two (they approved mine in 3 hours), and you can get an appointment within 1 - 3 weeks.
- Ottawa took 2 weeks to respond to my expedited request, and the earliest expedited interview date I ended up getting was later than the Toronto expedited date I got, despite Ottawa having shorter wait times on their web site. Ottawa seems a lot slower than Toronto for non-immigrant visas, and it seems like Toronto is better equiped for J1 Visa interviews (probably beacuse they see a lot more of them). 


> 💡 Yes, I booked an interview at both Ottawa and Toronto (and paid the fee twice). I was cutting it really close to my internship start date and wanted to maximize my options. It worked out for me - despite Ottawa having shorter wait times, Toronto's expedited interview date was earlier than Ottawa's, and I ended up getting my visa 2 days before my flight. A few hundred dollars wasted on the extra visa fee was worth not missing out on a week of salary if I had to start late.


- Calgary and Vancouver are decent consulates and better than Ottawa, but not as good as Toronto in terms of response times. Their wait times are typically the shortest, at least on paper.
- Halifax and Quebec City are pretty small consulates - at the time I was booking my interview, they didn't have any dates available at all.

> 💡 It is (unfortunately) common for people to have to fly to a different city with shorter wait times. I have heard of people flying from ON to Calgary/Vancouver, and some even got these flights reimbursed from their employer. However, note that because you submit your passport at the embassy, you **must** have some other form of Canadian ID to take a flight back home!

### Using the website
![Screenshot of DS-160 website](/j1-visa-guide/ds-160-website.png#center)

As you can tell, the website is about as old as the United States. Here are some things to keep in mind while using the website:

- The website lets you retrieve a saved application - make note of your application ID and security questions when you start an application.
- The form lets you save the form and come back to it later, but it will log you out after ~10 minutes of inactivity (though sometimes it will glitch out and log you out earlier). **Save your form frequently** - ideally every time you go to a new page of the form.
    - The form does not let you save the form if the form is failing validation, so if there are any errors in your form, fix those and hit save again.

### Digital Photograph
You need to submit a digital photograph that [matches the specifications](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/photos/digital-image-requirements.html) in your DS-160 form. The website tests and rejects photos that don't seem to match the specifications. You also need a physical copy of the image for your consulate interview.

My recommendation would be to go to a local photo studio that specializes in visa photographs, and get both a physical and digital copy - they do this kind of stuff daily and know the rules better than you do.

> 💡 The photograph they use for your Visa is the one you submit at the consulate interview (i.e. the one you submit digitally is overriden). I had actually used an incorrect photo for my DS-160 (I was wearing glasses), so I took a new photo from the studio and used that for my interview.
