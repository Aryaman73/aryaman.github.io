In many ways, getting my J1 Visa was harder than getting my internship, since there is no Blind 75 to help you overcome bureaucracy. Though there is a lot of information online, it can feel scattered and hard to find. This is particularly true for non Canadian citizens, since we have to do an interview at the US Consulate. That’s where this guide (hopefully) comes in.

Before I begin, here are some excellent guides made by fellow UW students:

### Basics

The J1 Visa is an "exchange visitor” visa, which is meant to give students, teachers or researchers the opportunity to study, train or work in the US. The key thing to note here is that this is not a traditional "work" visa (like TN or H1B), and is meant to be more for cultural exchange or training (in fact, exchange students studying at a US university also apply for the J1 Visa). This is why you will have a sponsor (like Intrax or Cultural Vistas) do the main leg work for the visa.

- The J1 Visa is issued according to the start and end date for your internship, but you can enter/leave the US **30 days** before/after the start/end date.

- The J1 Visa can be either **single-entry** (you can only enter the US once) or **multiple-entry** (you can enter the US multiple times before your internship end date). 
    - Multiple-entry visas are obviously preferable, and you can (allegedly) request one during your US consulate interview, though they may not grant it to you. Anecdotally, since 2023, everyone I have spoken to was given a multiple-entry visa without asking for it.

> ❗ Most non-Canadian J1 Visa holders are subject to a 2-year home residency requirement, which means that you have to return to your home country for 2 years before you can apply for a green card or H1B. Home country refers to your country of citizenship, so you can NOT clear this requirement by living in another country. **This is a VERY important thing to look into if you're an international student.**


### Process

1. Submit Info to your Sponsor (Intrax / Cultural Vistas)
2. Wait to get your DS 2019 and SEVIS payment receipt (now happens digitally!)
3. Fill-in your DS 160, submit it
4. Book an appointment at your country’s consulate
5. Go to the interview, submit passport
6. Received your passport in the mail / pick-up from Canada Post
