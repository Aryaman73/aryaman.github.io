This is my first post on this website. I've been meaning to start a technical-but-not-really blog for a while, partially to increase my ✨ web presence ✨, but mostly to create a space for me to talk about things I'm thinking about. If not for others to read, but for me to look back on.

 Behind this post was hours of deciding and researching between Jekyll, Gatsby, and Hugo. Jekyll is old and mature and uses Ruby, which is a language I'm trying to learn as part of my co-op. It also has integration with Github Pages, which is what I use to host my website. Gatsby is incredibly feature-rich and is built off React, a framework I am very familiar with, and is in high demand in the corporate world. Hugo is niche, small, and uses the weirdest templating syntax I've seen - but it had this pretty theme going for it. So here I am.

 I've spent the last few months contemplating on what kind of software developer - and person - I mean to be. The more I think about it, the more I realize I have no freaking clue. I'm not a huge fan of New Year Resolutions, and instead like to [plan my life around themes](https://www.themesystem.com/), and I've decided that my theme for this year is "Less Thinking and More Doing." This should hopefully explain why I decided to turn my website into a blog with - at the time of writing - a singular post.
